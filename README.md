# simple-python-calculator
The provided code is a python code named calculator.py, which functions as a simple command-line calculator. It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

1. The code starts with a series of print statements that create a simple text-based menu for the calculator, displaying the available operations (ADD, SUBTRACT, DIVIDE, MULTIPLY).

2. The user is prompted to select an operation by entering a corresponding number.

3. The user's input is stored in the variable `OPERATION` using the `input()` function.

4. The code uses a series of `if-elif-else` statements to determine which operation to perform based on the user's input.

5. For each operation (1 to 4), the code prompts the user to enter two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).

6. The code performs the selected arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, division, or multiplication) and prints the result.

7. After displaying the result, the code prompts the user if they want to perform another operation. The response is stored in the variable `again_operation`.

8. If the user entered an invalid operation, an error message is displayed, and the program thanks the user for using the calculator.

This code essentially implements a basic calculator in the console, allowing users to perform simple arithmetic operations interactively.
